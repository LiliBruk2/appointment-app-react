# Appointment_Project_React.js

React practical project built based on Ray Villalobos' course @LinkedIn Learning

The app presents three basic functions: 'display all appointments', which will load a list of appointments based on a json file, 'add new appointment' which will load a form to add a new temporary item and 'search for appointment' which allows a user add some input and get some results from the list.
